ThriveAssist: AI Journal & Health Assistant

Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that allows users to journal what happened in their day and answer three questions about themselves. Based on the journal entries and responses, the AI assistant provides personalized advice on how to improve their physical and mental health. The AI also generates three new follow-up questions based on the user's previous responses to answer in their next journal entry, promoting continuous self-reflection. Users can log in, register, and view their previous journal entries to track progress over time.
